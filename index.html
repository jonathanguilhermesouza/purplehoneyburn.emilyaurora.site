            Until one day, I started having a lot of pain in my chest, my husband wanted to know what was going on, none of us understood what happened, until I fainted.üòî

          <p>I almost went to heaven. </p><br />
          <p>My husband immediately called the hospital, who rescued me, I was having a heart attack, I was hospitalized for a few days but in the end everything worked out and I didn't have a tragic end. </p>
          <br />
          <p>My doctor said that if I continued with the food routine I had, it wouldn't last another 6 months. </p>

              <p>When my doctor sent me home with instructions for a new diet, I followed them religiously. </p><br />
              <p>Nothing changed. </p><br />
              <p>So then I joined a local gym for ‚Äúactive adults‚Äù...which only left me sore, sweaty, and exhausted with ZERO change in the numbers. </p><br />
              <p>Next I tried yoga‚Ä¶running‚Ä¶even spin classes...</p><br />
              <p>And when my personal trainer said ‚Äúabs are made in the kitchen‚Äù I went back to focusing on my diet.</p><br />
              <p><b>I tried eating vegan, keto, low carb, and even intermittent fasting...</b></p><br />
              <p>They worked for a really short time. </p><br />
              <p><b>And the second I stopped my numbers slowly started to creep back up. They just left me even more cranky and tired.</b></p> <br />
              <p>Working out every single day is not a sustainable way to live for me. I have a really busy life and knee pain....</p> <br />

              <p>And as if it was a sign from heaven, I had the weirdest encounter at the mall. </p><br />
              <p>I saw a man and woman both about my age, and they both had their hands full of bags. Between the two of them, it looked like they‚Äôd bought an entirely new wardrobe... All for her.  </p><br />
              <p>And I could tell she needed it, because her sundress was practically slipping off her shoulders! It was way, WAY too big on her... </p><br />
              <p>But the strangest thing of all was that I recognized her!</p><br />
              <p>It took me a second, but it turned out it was my old high school friend Susan‚Ä¶ only she was literally half the woman I remembered.</p><br />
              <p>Susan was always a sweetheart‚Ä¶but she was also the one to hide in the back of group photos because of her ‚Äúpuffiness‚Äù. </p><br />
              <p>So to see her now, looking like a magazine model, felt like a cruel twist of fate...</p><br />
              <p>Until she recognized me too.</p><br />
              <p>‚ÄúElizabeth! Oh my goodness... I heard about you having a bad time. How are you holding up?‚Äù</p><br />
              <p>As soon as I opened my mouth, the tears came pouring out. I just couldn‚Äôt keep the pain bottled in any longer.
              </p><br />
              <p>Thankfully, Susan and her boyfriend took me aside and helped me catch my breath. </p><br />
              <p>And once I recapped the whole story for her, they exchanged a knowing look.</p><br />
              <p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked.</p><br />
              <p>That‚Äôs when she pulled out a piece of paper and scribbled down a website address.</p><br />
              <p>‚ÄúJust watch the video there and it will explain everything. THIS is how I was able to get a whole new wardrobe...‚Äù</p><br />
              <p>So as soon as I got home, I watched the video like she said.</p><br />
              <p>Not only did the video change EVERYTHING I thought I knew about health and fitness... but when I started to ingest, the enzymes started to work in order to accelerate my metabolism, I completely transformed my body!</p><br />
              <p>From 275 down to 209‚Ä¶then 183‚Ä¶then 170‚Ä¶all the way down to 155...</p><br />
              <p>According to the doctor, these enzymes that are unlocked act like thousands of ants to balance our body.</p><br />
              <p>I was FLOORED by how fast and effective this technique was! </p><br />
