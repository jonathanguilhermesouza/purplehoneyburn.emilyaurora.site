            <p>My name is Emily Smith and I recently came across a way to get my old self back...</p><br />

            <p><b>Back in my 30s it was so easy.</b> I used to</p><br />

            <p>✅<b>Have energy</b> all day
            <p>✅<b>Easily get away</b> with eating burgers, fries, pizza and ice cream</p>
            <p>✅<b>Maintain a trim figure</b> Without going to the gym at all</p>
            <p>✅<b>Feel confident</b> in my clothes, and my swimsuit! </p><br />
            <p>But that changed... Somewhere in my early 40s.</p>

          <h1 class="text-light p-2">After 40 EVERYTHING Went Downhill. Fast.</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="p-5 description-size" style="text-align: left;">
          <p>Seemingly overnight, my once trim and petite figure started ballooning. I could not get away with eating
            whatever I wanted, unless I wanted to carry that around on my body forever! </p><br />
          <p>I used to just burn everything off without a second thought, but now, my body could no longer keep up. </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>My metabolism was not firing on all cylinders any more.</b> 😔 </p><br />
          <p>I could feel that my health was going backwards. I had low energy during the day. And was falling asleep in
            front of the TV in the early evening. </p><br />
          <p>That's not who I am! </p><br />
          <p>So, I would go to bed earlier at night, in the hope that it would give me better energy the next day. </p>
          <br />
          <p>But it didn't work. Some nights I’d even sleep 10 HOURS, and still be dragging my body the next day! </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>I knew it was bad. But even then I didn’t realize just how BAD it had gotten.</b></p><br />

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>One day I bumped into my daughter's friend from high school. But she didn't recognize me at first. I
                had to tell her who I was. And then before she could stop herself, she said something that hurt deeply.
                "Wow Mrs Smith, I didn't recognize you. <b>You were so much smaller back then.</b></p><br />
              <p>Wow, that was a real eye-opener. </p><br />
              <p>I've never owned a scale. I've never needed it as I always kept my shape. However I knew it was time to
                find out where I was at. So I went out and bought one for the first time ever. </p><br />
              <p>Tp be really honest, deep down in my soul I was afraid, trying to keep my eyes closed to my tragic
                reality. </p><br />
              <p>I got it home, put the battery in, and stepped on. </p><br />
              <p><b> I couldn't believe my eyes! 227!</b> </p><br />
              <p>That number hit me like a hammer. </p><br />
              <p>I went over to the bathroom mirror, and forced myself to take a good long look. </p><br />
              <p>And I mean REALLY look. </p><br />
              <p><b>I was tired, puffy, and bulging out all over the place. I was a mess. </b> </p><br />
              <p>I thought about that experience the rest of the day. I started thinking about how it was not only
                affecting me, but also my daughter. You see, for a long time I had only been thinking about ME. But what
                about my girl? <b> Was I even going to be there for her? </b> </p><br />
              <p>That evening as I was getting ready for bed, I made a decision. </p><br />

              <p>I started walking, but that didn't work. And it was so time consuming with no real reward. </p><br />
              <p>Then I decided to hire a personal trainer and even a nutritionist! But I could always tell they weren't
                taking me seriously. I could see in their eyers. </p><br />
              <p>They’d watch me walk in and think, <b>“Here comes another rolly-polly with zero self control!”</b> And
                then they’d put on their best fake smiles and give me all the usual advice. </p><br />
              <p>❌ <b>Eat smaller portions throughout the day!</b></p>
              <p>❌ <b>If you’re sore that means it’s working!</b></p>
              <p>❌ <b>At least you get a “cheat day”!</b></p><br />
              <p>I changed my eating. Many many times. I tried juice fasts, detoxes, elimination plans.</p><br />
              <p>Believe it or not I went vegan for a while. And then totally switched over to a high protein meat-only
                plan. Of course I had also tried Keto, Paleo, and every other fad. <br />
              <p><b>NOTHING WAS WORKING!</b></p> <br />
              <p>I looked into old home remedies I would read about on the internet. </p> <br />
              <p>Weird concoctions I'd make in the kitchen. </p> <br />
              <p>Pickle juice, lime juice, cider vinegar, lemons. And even one that used SODA! </p> <br />
              <p>Have you heard the one about sleeping with an onion next to your bed to increase your energy levels?
                Yep - tried that too! </p> <br />
              <p><b>Eventually I decided that I needed to go to the doctor, and see what he had to say. Maybe there was
                  more wrong with me than I realized.</b> </p> <br />

              <p><b>He began to tell me about this 7-Second Purple Honey that had recently been discovered.</b> And that
